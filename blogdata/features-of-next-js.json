    "content":"Next.js supports styling with CSS as well as precompiled Scss and Sass, CSS-in-JS, and styled JSX.[11] In addition, it is built with TypeScript support and smart bundling.[22] The open-source transpiler Babel is used to transform and compile code into JavaScript usable by a browser. Webpack, another open-source tool, is used to bundle the modules afterward. All of these tools are used with npm in a terminal.[12] The main feature of Next.js is its use of server-side rendering to reduce the burden on web browsers and provide enhanced security[citation needed]. This can be done for any part of the application or the entire project, allowing for content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering.[8] It can also be done only for first-time visitors, to reduce the burden on web browsers that have yet to download any of the site's assets.[9] The 'hot reloading' feature detects changes as they are made and re-renders the appropriate pages so the server avoids the need to be restarted. This allows changes made to the application code to be immediately reflected in the web browser, though some browsers will require the page to be refreshed.[8] The software uses page-based routing for developer convenience and includes support for dynamic routing. Other features include hot-module replacement so that modules can be replaced live, automatic code splitting, which only includes code necessary to load the page, and page prefetching to reduce load time.[8] Next.js also supports Incremental Static Regeneration[23] and static site generation - a compiled version of the website is usually built during build time and saved as a .next folder. When a user makes a request, the pre-built version which are static HTML pages are cached and sent to them. This makes the load time very fast, but it's not suitable for every website because for interactive sites that change often and utilize a lot of user input will not be suitable.",
